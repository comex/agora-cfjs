            Even though it fails to specify a power, it also clearly meant to
            specify it as 2.  In non-rule change cases, differences between what
            is said (as long as it's completely impossible - and in this case,
            setting the AI of a rule is impossible even for a proposal, because
            it's not defined) and what is meant (as long as it's completely clear)
            are sometimes resolved in favor of the latter, which is why I called
            it ambiguous.  (Then again, regular PF actions are supposed to be
            "unambiguous and clear", but I think historically we've treated rule
            changes more strictly, and the wording "*any* ambiguity" supports
            this.)

            Evidence:
                  Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
                  change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
                  variation in the quotation of an existing rule does not
                  constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
                  other variation does.
            and:
                  Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
                  announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
                  and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
                  it.

            For determining power in particular, R105(a) explicitly and directly
            clarifies the ambiguity (by setting power to 1 in the absence of
            specification), "before" the overall ambiguity of the effect should
            be assessed:
                   (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
                       of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
                       defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
                       specify or if it specifies a power less than one, and the
                       maximum power permitted by other rules.
            If R105(a) didn't have this explicit setting of Power, then I'd agree
            with the Caller.

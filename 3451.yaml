            Though if you ask me, the phrase 'Rule 2455 "How to Pend a Proposal"'
            is completely unambiguous. There's absolutely no reasonable doubt as
            to what the intended meaning of the phrase is, so the error
            constitutes "difference in spelling" which "does not create an
            ambiguity in meaning".

            A CFJ found differently IIRC, but I think in that case the mis-numbering
            referred accidentally to a different existing rule.
            As Rulekeepor, I wholly disagree that this is a different in "spelling",
            though it *may* still be clear enough depending what the precedent
            says...

            It was CFJ 1625. "Where a proposal specifies a rule to amend by both number
            and title, and the number and title given identify different rules, this
            constitutes ambiguity that nullifies the attempted rule change."
            That doesn't refer to when the other rule doesn't exist. But, the rules
            say, "An inconsequential variation in the quotation of an existing rule
            does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any other
            variation does." I think this would fall under "any other variation".

            Statement: Proposals 7773 and 7774 will have no effect if passed
            Main argument: the proposals refer to Rule 2445 by the ID 2455 (and the
            correct title).
            Relevant rules:
            Rule 2141/9 (Power=3)
            Role and Attributes of Rules
                     A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
                     game generally, and is always taking effect.  A rule's content
                     takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.
                     Every rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.  It is
                     not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.
                     Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.
                     Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
                     rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor SHALL assign a
                     title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
                     For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
                     the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
                     substantive aspects of the rule.  However, rules to the contrary
                     notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as
                     described elsewhere in this rule.
            ----
            Rule 105/12 (Power=3)
            Rule Changes
                     [...]
                     Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
                     change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
                     variation in the quotation of an existing rule does not
                     constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
                     other variation does.
                     [...]
            ----
            My judgment is overall in line with Tristan Bredeweg's arguments.
            There are two ways the incorrect specification could constitute "ambiguity"
            as relates to Rule 105. One is by the natural-language interpretation of
            the word; the other is by the second sentence quoted above â€“ "any other
            variation does".
            By the natural-language interpretation of ambiguity alone, I would deem
            that using the wrong ID, which is not used by any other rule, and the
            correct title, is clear enough. Ambiguity implies multiple potential
            meanings. There is no sensible way for the "incorrect" number 2455 to be an
            indication of another meaning, or an attempt at obfuscation of the
            proposal's effect, when there is no rule 2455 but there is a 2445. I deem
            this case to not fall under the precedent of CFJ 1625.
            However, the second sentence of the paragraph specifies that any variation,
            other than "inconsequential variation in the quotation of a rule",
            constitutes ambiguity. I take this to be an extra safety measure: even if,
            as in this case, the intended meaning was never really ambiguous to us (to
            me), the rules require a higher standard of clarity. So, is this an
            inconsequential variation in the quotation of the rule?
            The word "quotation", as opposed to "specification" or something else,
            along with Rule 2141's assertion that "[a] rule's content takes the form of
            a text", tells me that the only inconsequential quotations intended to be
            covered here, are inconsequential quotations of the rule's text. In a
            strict logical sense, every rule "has" a text, an ID, a title etc on the
            same relational-database-style level. However, the language used separates
            the text from the other rule properties: a rule's content is a text, and a
            rule additionally has some parameters. So in a way. a rule "is" a text,
            which "has" an ID. A "quotation of a rule" would then not cover the case of
            identifying it by its title and ID.
            Writing the string "Rule 2455, How to Pend a Proposal" is not a case of
            (incorrectly) quoting the rule. It is similar to how, say, writing a
            correct quote but misspelling the author's name is a case of misquoting the
            author. It is an error, but not that particular error. Thus, the error
            committed by proposals 7773 and 7774 falls under the "any other variation"
            language of Rule 105, and the proposals would have no effect if passed.
            I judge CFJ 3451 to be TRUE.

            Though if you ask me, the phrase 'Rule 2455 "How to Pend a Proposal"'
            is completely unambiguous. There's absolutely no reasonable doubt as
            to what the intended meaning of the phrase is, so the error
            constitutes "difference in spelling" which "does not create an
            ambiguity in meaning".

            A CFJ found differently IIRC, but I think in that case the mis-numbering
            referred accidentally to a different existing rule.
            As Rulekeepor, I wholly disagree that this is a different in "spelling",
            though it *may* still be clear enough depending what the precedent
            says...

            It was CFJ 1625. "Where a proposal specifies a rule to amend by both number
            and title, and the number and title given identify different rules, this
            constitutes ambiguity that nullifies the attempted rule change."
            That doesn't refer to when the other rule doesn't exist. But, the rules
            say, "An inconsequential variation in the quotation of an existing rule
            does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any other
            variation does." I think this would fall under "any other variation".

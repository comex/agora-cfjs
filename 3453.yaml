            Unless I'm mistaken, Trust Tokens were repealed as a result of our victory.

            I don't think Eras are necessarily tied to wins? Given random side scam
            wins happening in Agora around as often as gameplay wins, it would
            probably be a bad idea to do so.
            (I remember the "skunk" rule we had several years ago, that was used to
            prevent scam wins interfering with the scoring system, while still
            considering the wins to be wins. This seems to be the same sort of
            thing.)

            TRUE.  Nobody initiated a new Era.

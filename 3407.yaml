            The clause at issue is the last sentence of R991.  omd has not
            explicitly stated how e chooses judges, or how e's tracking
            "interested players".  I wondered, when I wrote that part of R991,
            whether a breach of this rule (if it happened) could even be
            detected, so this seems like as good a test case for the burden
            of proof on that clause as any.

            Then I have no choice but to judge DISMISS as there is insufficient evidence.

            I think you can plausibly argue that the referent of "its" in rule 106
            is ambiguous; if it refers to the decision rather than the rule, nothing
            is broken.
            Alternatively, you're trying to take the minimum of 4 and an undefined
            value. I'd have thought the most sensible resolution of this situation
            is to calculate the result as 4.

            As comex pointed out in the discussion forum, Proposal 7448 was
            submitted without an AI and purported to award me that Title, but was
            assumed to have failed to do so due to insufficient AI.
            If ais523's argument that the "minimum of 4 and its adotion index" is
            in fact 4, however, it succeeded.

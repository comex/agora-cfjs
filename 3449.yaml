            I think you can plausibly argue that the referent of "its" in rule 106
            is ambiguous; if it refers to the decision rather than the rule, nothing
            is broken.
            Alternatively, you're trying to take the minimum of 4 and an undefined
            value. I'd have thought the most sensible resolution of this situation
            is to calculate the result as 4.

            As comex pointed out in the discussion forum, Proposal 7448 was
            submitted without an AI and purported to award me that Title, but was
            assumed to have failed to do so due to insufficient AI.
            If ais523's argument that the "minimum of 4 and its adotion index" is
            in fact 4, however, it succeeded.

            Note: I've had some troubles finding a ruleset from Jun 2013 (when the
            resolution of proposal 7448 took place). I believe the relevant rules
            cited below existed back then, but I'm not 100% sure.
            "its adoption index" in R106 refers to the proposal, not to the
            decision, as the other "its" and the "it" in the same sentence also
            refer to the proposal. So if a proposal doesn't has an adoption index
            of "none", this results in fact in the power of the proposal being set
            to the minimum of four and "none".
            I agree with ais523's interpretation that the the minimum of four and
            none is four; mathematically, this seems to make sense: If we assume
            {'none'} = {} and "minimum of a and b := min {a,b}", then "minimum of
            none and four" evaluates to min {'none',4} = min {4} = 4.
            However, I don't believe proposal 7448's adoption index actually _was_
            'none' at the time R106 was applied to it. According to R2034,
            "A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision constitutes
            self-ratifying claims that [..] (if the indicated outcome was to adopt
            a proposal) such a proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.".
            The message resolving the relevant decision
            (https://www.mail-archive.com/agora-official@agoranomic.org/msg06802.html)
            clearly indicated the AI of proposal 7448 as 1. Nobody objected, so the
            claim self-ratified and caused p7748's AI to become 1 "at the time the
            ratified document was published" according to R1551, which I believe to
            be before the application of R106.
            Therefore, R016 "saw" a proposal with an AI of 1 and subsequently set
            the power of the proposal to 1 before causing it to take effect; so
            p7448 had in fact insufficient power to award an patent title.
            I judge FALSE and award myself a Blue Ribbon (I'm still 3h20 short of
            the deadline!).

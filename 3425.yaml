            (This has come up before, but I don't know offhand how drastically the
            relevant rules have changed since the last time.)

            Proto-judgement:
            [This is without regard to past precedent]
            Rule 2152/7 (Mother, May I?) reads in part:
                   5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.
            Therefore, any "attempt" to perform a CAN, where the CAN is not qualified
            by a method, will succeed if we can say that a legal "attempt" took place.
            For an attempt to change a regulated quantity, the attempt must communicate
            with the recordkeepor, and we generally require clear communication.  A
            message to a discussion forum would not qualify, as following a discussion
            forum is not required.  However, sending a public message would clearly
            legally communicate the attempt to all players, and so would be a legal
            "attempt" to perform the action.
            Note that this is not directly and officially "by announcement" exactly,
            as the last paragraph of R478 reserves that for cases where "CAN by
            announcement" is actually stated.  Instead, the "attempt" is performed by
            announcement, which then causes the action to succeed.  So, strictly and
            technically speaking, the "attempt" is by announcement, and the attempt
            causes the action to succeed, but that's not *quite* the same as the
            action being performed by announcement.
            FALSE on a technicality; the action succeeds, but via the announcement of
            attempt and R2152, not "CAN by announcement" as per R478.  This technicality
            is important, as it ensures that "CAN by method X" isn't severable into
            "CAN (by announcement attempt) by method X".

            I attempt to join agora nomic.  I attempt to leave agora nomic.  I wonder if either of those are effective in this bak channel.  I assume yes.  I wonder if this message will just be seen as an annoyance, I assume maybe.

            Arguments: I don't see any reason why "I attempt to leave" would be ineffective.

            The intent is at least as clear as the preceding one. If neither are
            sufficient, then Quazie never became a player. If both are, e briefly was
            but then left. In both cases, the outcome is the same in regards to this
            CFJ: TRUE.

            The judgement I gave is the *exact opposite* of the one I have argued for.
            I should sleep more. Let's start over.
            I file a Motion to Reconsider on this case. I judge it exactly the same way
            as I did before, save for a better attention to detail and s/TRUE/FALSE/.

            This argument isn't quite complete, because deregistering is by
            announcement, while registering has a considerably looser standard...
            (not that I think there was any lack of clarity in this case)

            That's what I was getting at with the CFJ, though of course I was just being
            silly too.

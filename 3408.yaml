            Arguments: The voting period ends platonically 7 days after it begins. The
            requirement is that the Assessor resolve the decision in a timely fashion
            thereafter. Therefore I have another 5 days to resolve.

            This is correct.  Also, the relevant rule is 208; Rule 107 requires
            the vote collector (without a time limit) to end the voting period of
            a decision with less than two options, but decisions to adopt
            proposals have two options.  FALSE.

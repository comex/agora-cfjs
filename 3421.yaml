            CFJ:  omd is known as offense most dire.  I bar Henri
            CFJ:  omd is known as oddly marked derriere.  I bar Henri
            Arguments
            In CFJ [citation needed], it was found that I could "give" root the
            nickname Beverly, and use it in direct context of a message, but that
            the use of such temporary nicknames did NOT have an effect on the
            nickname tracked by the Registrar.  Recently, omd has started signing
            messages with three-word phrases with the initials omd.  I claim that
            this does NOT make em "known by" such names.  If it does when omd
            uses it (first CFJ), then it should be when others use it (second CFJ).

            Gratuitous arguments: Many players seem to be interpreting the signature
            rule as allowing a particular signature /pattern/. For instance, omd
            signs eir messages using words that start with "o", "m", and "d";
            Roujo's messages tend to have a signature that involves translations or
            synonyms for "red water" ("Roujo" itself can be seen as following this
            pattern, phonetically in French).
            G. recently signing messages using omd's signature pattern is actually
            pretty confusing, given that it's a similar situation as a player using
            a nickname belonging to another player. It's unclear whether a signature
            pattern can belong to more than one player, but it seems unlikely. (The
            situation seems comparable to that of hashtag wars on Twitter, where two
            different communities will attempt to use the same, globally-namespaced,
            name for different things, confusing searches.)

            Evidence: See the timestamps above.
            Arguments: G. published a Claim of Error about Henri's Registrar report;
            then Henri published a revision to the report, two minutes later, but
            apparently unrelated to the original CoE. Does this satisfy eir
            requirement to respond to a CoE, seeing as it seems to have been
            accidental? (The original document seems to remain doubted in any case,
            because the CoE has not been denied.) The distinction is as to whether
            publishing a revision has to be done specifically in response to the
            CoE, or whether even unrelated revisions count.

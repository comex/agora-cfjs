            Evidence: See the timestamps above.
            Arguments: G. published a Claim of Error about Henri's Registrar report;
            then Henri published a revision to the report, two minutes later, but
            apparently unrelated to the original CoE. Does this satisfy eir
            requirement to respond to a CoE, seeing as it seems to have been
            accidental? (The original document seems to remain doubted in any case,
            because the CoE has not been denied.) The distinction is as to whether
            publishing a revision has to be done specifically in response to the
            CoE, or whether even unrelated revisions count.

            JUDGE'S ARGUMENTS
            There is not a lot to say for this one. The purpose of a CoE is to
            prevent an erroneous document from self-ratifying. The published
            revision fixed the problem mentioned in the the CoE, whether or not
            Henri explicitly mentions that e is responding to a CoE. Requiring em to
            send an identical revision specifically in response to the CoE makes no
            sense.
            I judge CFJ 3420 TRUE

            And this is why I should not do anything when I'm tired.
            Because the purpose of the CoE is to get it fixed (if it is wrong),
            because the changes were unrelated to the error, and because it was in
            no way in response to the CoE:
            I judge CFJ 3420 FALSE

            Assets or other "item" rules don't currently exist.  Henri was "issued"
            a Red Card and apologized.  Was the red card destroyed?  Was the implied
            metaphor of it being a real "card" give enough common definition space
            to make it a "thing" that must be destroyed, or is the only thing
            tracked the date of issuance?  The referee is in charge of "keeping
            track of wrongdoing" but there's no guidance on what is supposed to be
            tracked.

            DISMISS as irrelevant, as there are currently no rules that depend on
            the answer (at least none that explicitly mention Red Cards).  If there
            were, and the rules were still silent on the issue, then common sense /
            best interests / etc. would depend on what those rules were.

            ARGUMENTS
            Rule 2429 puts special status on "paragraphs" when considering
            whitespace.  However, paragraphs are not defined.
            Rule 1728 consists of several nested lists.  Some list items
            are separated by a blank line, some list items aren't.  The
            first block list (items 1-4) seems like a single paragraph,
            while later lists in the Rule seem like multiple paragraphs.
            So how many paragraphs are in Rule 1728, among multiply-nested
            lists?  (This is so I know my flexibility as a Rulekeepor for
            formatting lists).
            EVIDENCE
            Rule 1728/33 (Power=3)
            Dependent Actions
                   A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
                   perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
                   methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):
                    1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
                       greater than 8.  ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this
                       method with N = 1.)
                    2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  ("With
                       Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
                    3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
                       with a minimum of 1.
                    4) With Notice.
                   thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
                   of the following are true:
                    a) A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
                       action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
                       method(s) (including the value of N for each method), at
                       most fourteen days earlier, and (if the action depends on
                       objections or notice) at least 4 days earlier.
                    b) At least one of the following is true:
                         1) The performer is the initiator.
                         2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
                            to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
                            performer.
                         3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
                            action depends on support, the performer has supported
                            the intent, and the rule authorizing the performance
                            does not explicitly prohibit supporters from performing
                            it.
                    c) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
                       other rules.
                    d) If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
                       given in the announcement of intent to perform the action,
                       all those conditions are met.
                   The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
                   depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
                   objections.

            Bleach
                   Replacing a non-zero amount of whitespace with a different
                   non-zero amount of whitespace is generally insignificant, except
                   for paragraph breaks.

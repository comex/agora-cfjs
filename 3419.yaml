            The wording of the rule implies that the rule instantaneously creates an
            ongoing obligation, rather than continuously creating an instantaneous
            obligation. Can such an obligation persist beyond the rule's expiry?

            And I'd have thought that would go to Murphy again?

            The Rule in question:
            ----
            Rule 1789/9 (Power=2)
            Cantus Cygneus
                  Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
                  by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
                  of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled
                  a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
                  reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
                  In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
                  Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
                  Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the
                  Player to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method
                  of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
                  Reports.
                  The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
                  the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
                  henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
                  FAGE.
            ----
            Judge's arguments:
            The second paragraph creates an obligation to note the method of
            deregistration in subsequent Registrar Reports. If the third paragraph
            had not been present, it is obvious to me that the general assumption
            that only current rules regulate play. Thus, if the rule were to be
            repealed (in the case of no third paragraph, that is), it would have
            no power over subsequent Registrar Repots. Compare with a rule that
            says "every player who registered after [date] must [obligation]", a
            sort of grandfather clause. Repealing such a rule removes the
            requirement to [obligation] – the alternative would be that the rules
            have to state that "players need not do x" for every obligation that
            has ever been present in the rules, which is absurd.
            The third paragraph might be read as challenging this, with even more
            words spend on emphasising the temporal reach of the rule. Compared to
            ordinary rules which only say "X is the case", this rule states both
            that "X shall be the case for all subsequent reports" and "henceforth,
            X will be the case". (The word "will" is not rules-defined.) Surely,
            this means the rule has greater power to affect the future?
            No. My judgment is still no. Once repealed, a rule does not regulate
            play. What would otherwise be the point of repealing rules? Several
            rules state that certain information is part of the Registrar's
            various reports. If Rule 1789 were repealed, it would no longer be
            counted among them.
            I judge CFJ 3419 FALSE.
            As for the caller's secondary question, more generally: "Can such an
            obligation persist beyond the rule's expiry?" I have a hard time
            seeing how this would come to pass.
            -Tiger

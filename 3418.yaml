              Conventionally, when one refers to "midnight Monday", what would
              first come to mind is the midnight during the night of Monday, not
              Midnight during the morning of Monday. For example, when one asks
              another to meet em at "midnight tomorrow", the other would
              conventionally think of "midnight tomorrow" to be midnight during
              tomorrow night rather than midnight tomorrow morning.
              Since no dictionary precisely defines "midnight" as either 0:00 or
              24:00, it is best to follow the conventional approach to defining
              midnight which is 24:00.

            Gratuitous: Aside from common sense factors, the previous clause says
            that Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.  Your interpretation would
            have Agoran days beginning at the end of regular days (i.e. to the
            extent this semantically differs, even though it refers to the same
            time, the end of Monday rather than the beginning of Tuesday), as
            opposed to the more straightforward intepretation where the beginning
            of the Agoran day is the beginning of the regular day.
            But really, "midnight" is one thing, "midnight UTC" is another.  I
            would never see that as anything other than 00:00.

            Gratuitous arguments: Nobody I know uses it like that. If someone
            tells me at midnight tomorrow, I understand "tonight". If e actually
            meant "tomorrow night at midnight", e should have clarified. Not that
            I do much at midnight most days, but eh.
            More arguments: I think that if we're debating about whether it's 0:00
            or 24:00, it's not really well defined at all. "Should be considered
            as 24:00"? Maybe. "Is defined as 24:00"? I don't think so. Maybe
            there's a CfJ somewhere that could establish precedent, but my DB is
            still offline and being at work I'd rather not start going through the
            DB dump manually.
            Then again, here I am writing arguments for fun, so I guess that's not
            much of an excuse. =P

            Gratuitous argument:  I know too many people who use it like that.  And
            they are wrong, wrong, WRONG.

            FALSE per the gratuitous arguments.

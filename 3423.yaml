            I shamelessly assign this CFJ to myself, as I am the most interested
            in it.  I judge it TRUE.  I intend to enter this judgement into Moot
            with 2 support.  -G.

            I publish the following Brief: FALSE, because I put G. at 172 points,
            fewer than Henri, scshunt, and omd.
